# Performance and Accessibility Guidelines

## Performance Optimization

- Use `React.memo` for expensive components
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` properties
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting

## Animation Performance

- Use Framer Motion's `motion.div` for containers
- Use `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount animations
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- Keep animations smooth at 60fps
- Use `will-change` CSS property for animated elements

## Accessibility Requirements

- Use proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Implement keyboard navigation support
- Ensure screen reader compatibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain proper focus management
- Ensure color contrast compliance

## Form Accessibility

- Use proper form labels and descriptions
- Associate error messages with form fields
- Use `aria-invalid` for validation states
- Implement proper focus management
- Support keyboard navigation

## Loading States

- Show appropriate loading indicators
- Use skeleton screens for better UX
- Provide clear feedback during async operations
- Handle loading errors gracefully
- Use consistent loading patterns across components

## Error States

- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Use proper error boundaries
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- Provide recovery options when possible
